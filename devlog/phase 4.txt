All progress points for phase 4 were attained in...well,
about 10 minutes. You add the data in the note.fields array,
and collection.py does all of the work for you with the addNote
function.

Now it's time to expand upon the "???" in phase 5, and create
hopefully the last timeline revision.

phase completed: 9/18
