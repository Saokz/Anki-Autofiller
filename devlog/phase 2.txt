Failed to complete the goals at the designated dates.

Main issue:

	I massively underestimated how long it was going to take to learn and understand
	the source code for Anki. Plus I procrastinated on working on this pretty hard.
	
	Turns out you can't just "add" a card, or a note (and I'm just now learning that those
	are two separate entities that I need to know the difference for). Adding a note/card
	means updating and syncing carefully managed infromation in a database, and that's
	completely uncharted territory for me.
	
	So I've been learning about databases and SQLite3 and spending some more time with the
	source code.
	
	I'm going to be a little behind in the project timeline as a result.
